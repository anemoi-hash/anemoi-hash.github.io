    <h1>Anemoi: a Family of ZK-friendly AO Hash Functions.</h1>
    <p>Anemoi is part of the Arithmetization-Oriented primitives designed for 
  	advanced cryptographic protocols such as Zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs of 
  	knowledge.<br>
  	More precisely,	Anemoi is a new family of ZK-friendly permutations, that can 
  	be used to construct efficient hash functions and compression functions.</p>
